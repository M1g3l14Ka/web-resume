# Hi there 👋

## Live Demo: [https://michael-resume.vercel.app/](https://michael-resume.vercel.app/)

## Features

This is my personal interactive resume designed to showcase my skills and projects. It features a cyberpunk-inspired UI and includes a fully functional "Hire Me" modal with real-time email routing, allowing recruiters to send job offers directly to my inbox.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack

- **Core:** Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Integrations:** Resend (Email API) + Server Actions

## 🗂️ Structure

- **Hero Section:** Quick introduction, dynamic background, and the "Hire Me" action trigger.
- **Timeline & Projects:** A structured view of my commercial experience and interactive cards for my pet projects.
- **Footer:** Copyright and essential links.

## 🤪 What I Learned

- Deepened my knowledge of Tailwind CSS (complex gradients, grid layouts).
- Successfully integrated a real-world email service (Resend) using Next.js backend capabilities.
- Leveled up my animation skills with Framer Motion (scroll-driven effects, staggered appearances).
- Improved overall Next.js project architecture and component isolation.

## 🤔 Future Improvements

- Implementing even smoother, highly complex animations.
- Adding more micro-interactions for better user engagement.
- Adding unit and integration tests.
- Implementing dark/light theme toggle.
